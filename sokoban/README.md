# Sokoban for the Minimal 64

My first attempt to write a game for the Minimal 64.
You can find everything about the Minimal 64 here:

The game is a Sokoban clone. In the first version there are 90 playable levels.

I played Sokoban at the end of the 1980s on the XT PC with CGA graphics. You can still find it on YouTube today.
